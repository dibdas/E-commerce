without using the accesstoken if we need to access the routes ,inside stapi go to settings->roles->public i.e the
unauthenticated user then go to ->order
->enable customOrderController and save it
therfore ebaling the order api can be accessed by the unauthenticated user
copy and pate the code from strapi documentation


go to USERS & PERMISSIONS PLUGIN and provide access to customOrderController, which you have created

entityService is just like mongoose

services are like functions

routes->policy-> midleware-> controller

secret key is the backend to get the stripe backend api

publishable is in the frontend to redirect to checkout page
